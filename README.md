# ðŸš— Electric Vehicle Data Analysis & Insights

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of electric vehicles (EVs) to uncover meaningful insights, test hypotheses, and provide actionable recommendations.  
The dataset contains detailed specifications such as **electric range**, **energy consumption**, **price**, and other technical attributes.  

The goal is to:
- Conduct thorough data analysis.
- Perform hypothesis testing.
- Build an **EV recommendation system**.
- Present actionable recommendations for customers and stakeholders.

## ðŸ“¦ Tasks & Deliverables

### **Task 1 â€“ EV Filtering & Grouping**
**Objective:** Help a customer with a **budget of 350,000 PLN** and a **minimum range of 400 km**.
1. Filter EVs meeting the criteria. *(2 Marks)*
2. Group the filtered EVs by manufacturer (**Make**). *(6 Marks)*
3. Calculate the **average battery capacity** for each manufacturer. **

---

### **Task 2 â€“ Outlier Detection**
- Identify EVs with unusually **high or low energy consumption** (`Mean - Energy consumption [kWh/100 km]`). **

---

### **Task 3 â€“ Relationship Analysis**
- **a)** Create a plot showing the relationship between **Battery Capacity** and **Range (WLTP)**. *(8 Marks)*  
- **b)** Highlight insights from the visualization. *(8 Marks)*

---

### **Task 4 â€“ EV Recommendation System**
- Build a **class-based recommendation system** that:
  1. Accepts **budget**, **desired range**, and **battery capacity** as inputs.
  2. Returns the **top 3 EVs** matching the criteria. **

---

### **Task 5 â€“ Hypothesis Testing**
**Objective:** Determine if thereâ€™s a **significant difference** in **average engine power (KM)** between **Tesla** and **Audi**.
- Perform a **two-sample t-test** using `ttest_ind` from `scipy.stats`. **
- Draw insights from the results.
